# Processed Data Directory

This directory stores intermediate datasets derived from raw downloads. Files are not tracked in Git.

## Contents (HDD_v1)

- `colData.csv`: harmonized compound metadata assembled from AnnotationDB, LINCS, JUMP-CP, and DeepChem BBBP.
- `DEEP_CHEM/`: raw DeepChem CSVs (BBBP, ToxCast, Tox21, SIDER, ClinTox) used to build experiments.
- `experiments/bioassays.csv`: AnnotationDB bioassay outcomes (filtered to gold-standard AIDs).
- `experiments/binding_db.csv`: BindingDB affinity matrix (targets x compounds).
- `experiments/{toxcast,tox21,sider,clintox}.csv`: DeepChem experiment matrices.
- `experiments/fingerprints/Morgan.*.csv`: Morgan count fingerprint matrices for configured radii and dimensions.

## Notes

- Generated by Snakemake rules and scripts in `workflow/scripts/`.
- Do not edit manually; re-run the pipeline if inputs or configuration changes.
- Document any version changes in `docs/data_sources.md`.
